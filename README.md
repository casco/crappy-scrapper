A crappy example of how to use request, xpath, and xmldo, to obtain a web page and select its title tags.

You need nodejs and npm install

to install dependencies run:
```
npm intall
```

To use it (in linux) first make your index.js file executable (sudo chmod u+x index.js). Then run:

```
./index.js http://www.google.com
```
